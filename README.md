# **PROJECT PLANNER 2.0**
This is a CLI-running project planner, allowing the user to add, store, modify and archive projects. Currently the planner supports two types of projects, one being everyday projects, and the other being programming projects. All projects contain the variables name, start date, finish date, notes, progress and status, with programming projects also containing the possibility to add a GitHub link to the project repository, and what programming language(s) are being used in the project. Other types of projects may be added at a later date.



## **MAIN MENU**
The main menu allows the user:
* Add new projects
* View projects by type
* View project archives
* Exit the program

### **ADD PROJECT MENU**
This menu allows the user to:
* Chose what type of project you want to add (programming/everyday)
* Return to the main menu
* Exit the program

### **VIEWING ACTIVE PROJECTS**
From the main menu the user can chose to view active projects by type. From each project type, the user has the option to:
* Add a new project of the same type
* Modify a project
* Archive a project
* Return to main menu
* Exit program

### **MODIFY ACTIVE PROJECT**
When viewing a active projects of either type (programming or everyday), a project can be selected for modification. When doing this, the user can modify any parameter of the project, and pressing Enter without adding input will leave the parameter unchanged.

### **ARCHIVING PROJECTS**
When viewing active projects of either type, a project can be selected for archiving. This moves the project from active projects to the archive for the current project type, as well as to the full archive. Once archived, projects cannot be modified further.

### **VIEWING ARCHIVED PROJECTS**
